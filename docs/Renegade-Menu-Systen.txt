     In this list, "NN" is the command number, "KK" are the keys used to
     execute the command, "Typ" is the type of command it is, and "Options" is
     the command data.
          (D)elete command - Removes one of the menu commands.

          (I)nsert command - Inserts a new menu command somewhere in the
               menu.  You can insert more than one menu command at one time.

          (L)ong generic menu - Displays how the long menu listing will look.

          (M)odify commands - This command allows you to modify the information
               of the different commands.

          (T)oggle display type - Toggles between the 2 formats which Renegade
               will use to display the menu commands on the menu:

               The first is shown up above; it is more concise, and takes up
               less space than the alternate one (which is more descriptive).

          (X)Menu data/command data display mode toggle - Toggles between
               the menu command list mode, and another, separate list of
               information about the menu.

  CHAPTER 11-A
  ____________

     When you activate the (M)odify command, you will be asked which command
     to modify.  After you enter the command number, a menu like the following
     is displayed:
     ____________________________________________________________

     Menu filename: EMAIL
     Command #1 of 9

     1. Long descript :(R)ead Mail - Read private Electronic mail
     2. Short descript:(R)ead Mail
     3. Menu keys     :R
     4. ACS required  :""
     5. Cmdkeys       :MM
     6. Options       :
        Flags         :None
     Q. Quit

     Edit menu (?=help) :
     ____________________________________________________________

          1    This field stores a long description of the menu command.
               If the menu keys are "GTITLE", this is the title.

          2    This field stores a shorter description of the menu command.

          3    This is the actual string that the user enters when he wants
               to execute the command.

               If the menu key is more than one character in length, and the
               first character of the menu key is not a slash character
               ("/"), the user must enter two slashes in a row ("//"), and then
               the rest of the command.

               If a command has the menu key "FIRSTCMD", they will be
               executed first, before the user is able to enter any commands.

               If a command has the menu key "EVERYTIME", the command
               will be executed everytime the prompt is displayed, and after
               the menu is displayed to non-expert mode users.

               If a command has the menu key "GTITLE", the line in
               Long Description is displayed as another title.

               If a command has the menu key "ENTER", the key to access the
               command will be the enter key.

               If a command has the menu key " " (space), the key to access
               the command will be the spacebar.

               If a command has the menu key UP_ARROW, DOWN_ARROW, LEFT_ARROW,
               or RIGHT_ARROW, the key to access the command will be the
               corresponding cursor key for menus that trap local and remote
               cursor key movement.

          4    This is the ACS requirement that the user must satisfy to use
               or see the command.

          5    This is the type of command to be executed.  A full description
               of all the possible types commands is in Chapter 11-D.  If you
               have "GTITLE" as the ACS, leave this blank.

          6    This string contains command-particular information.  If the
               command uses this line, a short description is with the
               command in Chapter 11-D.  If you have "GTITLE" as the ACS,
               this line is the color set for the options after the title.
               (Bracket Color;Command Color;Description Color.  (ie: 4;0;5),
               see description of this in Chapter 11-B)

          [    Displays the previous menu command.

          ]    Displays the next menu command.

          F    Displays the first menu command.

          J    Displays the specified menu command.

          L    Displays the last menu command.

  Please read Appendix D for a definition of the flags.

  CHAPTER 11-B
  ____________

     When you press the "X" key at the main editor menu, you switch the
     display to show the other menu information:
     __________________________________________________________________

     Menu filename: MAIN
     1. Menu titles   :-= Renegade BBS =-
        Menu title #2 :-- Main Menu --

     Q. Quit

     Menu editor (?=help) :
     __________________________________________________________________

          1    This field contains the title(s) of the current menu.

          2    This command inputs the filenames which make up the menus of
               your menu system.  The generic menus are specified if you set
               the strings to null.

               The first filename is the normal menu display, and the
               second filename is the longer menu display.  If a "@S"
               occurs in either of these two filenames, it is replaced with
               the current user's SL.

          3    This field contains the menu prompt that is displayed before it
               will accept commands from the user.  It can be up to 120
               characters long.

          4    This is the ACS requirement that the user must have to use the
               menu.  If the user does not have access, they will be sent to
               the fallback menu.

          5    If a menu has a password attached to it and a user attempts
               to enter the menu, the menu will ask for the password.  If the
               entered password is incorrect, the user is sent to the fallback
               menu.

          6    This is a legal menu file which is loaded whenever the user
               does not have access to the current menu or if a menu error
               occurs.

          7    The help level setting that is forced when the user enters
               the menu.  The help levels are:

                    0 -- No help level forcing.
                    1 -- Expert level (only the prompt is shown).
                    2 -- Normal level (the short menu is displayed).
                    3 -- Novice level (the long menu is displayed).

          8    This entry includes all the information that is used to
               generate the generic menus.

                        C. Generic columns  :4
                          How many columns of commands there are.
                        1. Bracket color    :1
                          The color of the bracket around the command
                          letter.
                        2. Command color    :9
                          The color of the command letter inside the
                          brackets.
                        3. Description color:1
                          The color of the description of the command.
                        S. Show menu
                          Shows the short generic menu.

          9    There are several functions for each menu that may be
               flagged on or off:

                        (C)lear screen     (D)on't center titles
                        (N)o menu prompt   (P)ause before display
                        (T)ime display     (F)orce line input
                        (1) No ANS prompt  (2) No AVT prompt
                        (3) No RIP prompt  (4) No Global Disp
                        (5) No global use

                C:  Toggles clearing of the screen before menu display.
                D:  Toggles if the menu titles will get centered.
                N:  Toggles if the menu prompt is displayed.
                P:  Toggles if there is a pause before the menu is displayed.
                T:  Toggles the generic Time Left prompt.
                F:  Toggles if hotkeys are allowed or not.
                1:  Toggles Menu Prompt for ANSI Users.
                2:  Toggles Menu Prompt for AVATAR Users.
                3:  Toggles Menu Prompt for RIP Users.
                4:  Toggles whether or not the global menu commands are
                    displayed in current menu.
                5:  Toggles whether or not the global commands are available
                    for this menu.

  CHAPTER 11-C
  ____________

     When a user activates a menu command, Renegade executes all of the
     commands which have the command letters which were entered by the user.
     If two different commands both have the same command letters in them,
     both commands are executed in the order they are in the menu.

     When linking commands together, remember to put a description only on
     the first command in the link, and set the rest to null.  This stops
     Renegade from displaying the command several times on the generic menu.

  CHAPTER 11-D
  ____________

        The Command Keys are 2 letter codes which make Renegade do a certain
     function. (<> means Optional, [] means required, {} means pick one.)
